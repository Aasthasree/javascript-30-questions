// An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:

// The player with the highest score is ranked number  on the leaderboard.
// Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.

Answer: 
function climbingLeaderboard(ranked: number[], player: number[]): number[] {
    const uniqueRanks = Array.from(new Set(ranked));

    const result: number[] = [];
    let i = uniqueRanks.length - 1; 

    player.forEach(score => {
        while (i >= 0 && score >= uniqueRanks[i]) {
            i--; 
        }
        result.push(i + 2); 
    });

    return result;

}
