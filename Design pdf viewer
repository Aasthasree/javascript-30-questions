// When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. For example:
// There is a list of 26 character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index 0 and 'z' is at index 25. There will also be a string. Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mm2 assuming all letters are 1mm wide.

Answer: function designerPdfViewer(h: number[], word: string): number {
     let maxHeight = 0;

    for (let char of word) {
        const index = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
        maxHeight = Math.max(maxHeight, h[index]);
    }

    return maxHeight * word.length;

}
