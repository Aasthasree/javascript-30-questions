Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = 15.
The right-to-left diagonal = 17.
Their absolute difference is 2.

Sample Input

STDIN      Function
-----      --------
3           arr[][] sizes n = 3, m = 3
11 2 4     arr = [[11, 2, 4], [4, 5, 6], [10, 8, -12]]
4 5 6
10 8 -12
Sample Output

15
Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

11
   5
     -12
Sum across the primary diagonal:4 .

The secondary diagonal is:

     4
   5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal:19 
Difference: 15


  Answer:

   function diagonalDifference(arr: number[][]): number {
    let firstSum = 0;
    let secondSum = 0;
    
    arr.forEach((row,i) => {
        firstSum += row[i];
        secondSum += row[row.length-1-i];
    })
    
    return Math.abs(firstSum-secondSum);
}
