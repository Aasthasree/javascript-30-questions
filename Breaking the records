// Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

Answer : function breakingRecords(scores: number[]): number[] {
    let minScore = scores[0];
    let maxScore = scores[0];
    let minCount = 0;
    let maxCount = 0;
    
    scores.forEach((score, index) => {
        if (index === 0) return 
        
        if (score > maxScore) {
            maxScore = score;
            maxCount++;
        } else if (score < minScore) {
            minScore = score;
            minCount++
        }
    })
     return [maxCount, minCount];
}
