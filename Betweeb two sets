There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.


Answer:
function getTotalX(a: number[], b: number[]): number {
    const gcd = (x: number, y: number): number => y === 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y);
    const lcm = (x: number, y: number): number => (x * y) / gcd(x, y);

    let lcmA = a.reduce((acc, val) => lcm(acc, val)); 
    let gcdB = b.reduce((acc, val) => gcd(acc, val));  

    let count = 0;
    for (let x = lcmA; x <= gcdB; x += lcmA) {
        if (gcdB % x === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;

}
